# Simple Banking Application in Java

## Overview

The **Simple Banking Application** is a Java project that simulates basic banking operations. It's a great way to practice fundamental programming concepts. Here's what it includes:

- **Scanner Class Usage**: I've used the `Scanner` class to handle user input for account transactions.
- **Loop Methods**: Loops ensure smooth execution of repetitive tasks within the application.
- **Conditional Treatments**: I've implemented conditions to handle various scenarios (e.g., withdrawals, deposits).

## Features

1. **Deposits**: Users can add funds to their account.
2. **Withdrawals**: Funds can be withdrawn when needed.
3. **Checking Balance**: Users can inquire about their account balance.
4. **Exiting the Program**: A graceful exit option is available.
